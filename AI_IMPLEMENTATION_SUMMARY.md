- Still very affordable (~$10-20/month for high traffic)

---

The chatbot matches your website's neomorphism design:

- **Colors:** Uses your existing CSS variables
- **Shadows:** Soft, layered shadows
- **Typography:** Consistent with site
- **Animations:** Smooth, professional
- **Mobile:** Fully responsive

## 📱 Example Conversation

```
👤 User: "How much does a website cost?"

🤖 AI: "Website costs at Raijin Tech Hub vary based on complexity:
      - Basic website: Starting from UGX 2-5M
      - E-commerce platform: UGX 8-15M
      - Custom web application: UGX 15M+
      
      Would you like to tell me more about your project? 
      I can connect you with our team for a detailed quote! 💼"

[🟢 Connect on WhatsApp button appears]

---

👤 User: "Do you build mobile apps?"

🤖 AI: "Yes! We specialize in mobile app development for both 
      iOS and Android using React Native and Flutter.
      
      Typical projects take 2-3 months and start from 
      UGX 10-20M depending on complexity.
      
      What kind of app are you thinking about? 📱"

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

Want to enhance further? Consider:

1. **Customize AI Personality**
   - Edit `src/utils/geminiAI.js`
   - Adjust tone, response length, etc.

2. **Add More Quick Replies**
   - Based on common questions
   - Update `QUICK_REPLIES` array

   - Review Gemini API usage
   - Gather user feedback

---

## 📊 Analytics Tracking

The chatbot automatically tracks:

- **"AI Chat Widget Opened"** - When users open chat
- **"AI Chat Message Sent"** - Each message sent
- **"WhatsApp Handoff from AI"** - When users escalate

View these in Google Analytics (if configured):
`Events → [Event Name]`

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- ✅ API key stored in `.env.local` (not in code)
- ✅ `.env.local` is gitignored (won't be committed)
- ✅ No conversation data stored permanently
- ✅ HTTPS encryption for API calls
- ✅ Safe for free tier (rate limits prevent abuse)

**For production:** API key will be exposed in frontend (acceptable for free tier). For paid tier, consider adding a simple backend proxy.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Chat not appearing?
- Scroll down the page (appears after 300px)

### "Failed to initialize AI" error?
- Check `.env.local` file exists
- Verify API key is correct
- Restart dev server

### Slow responses?
- Normal response time: 1-3 seconds
- Check your internet connection
- Verify you haven't exceeded free tier limits

### Need help?
- Read `AI_CHATBOT_SETUP.md` for detailed guide
- Check browser console for errors
- Review Gemini API dashboard for usage/errors
